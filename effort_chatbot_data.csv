Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

            An Activity process is a collection of activities sequenced using conditions. You cannot
            perform an activity until the previous activities are completed based on the
            configuration. An Activity process is complete only when an End Activity is reached.

            activities in whatever way you want. All the work activities in a checklist process are
            independent and allow you to perform any work activity without depending on the other
            work activities. A Checklist process is complete only when all the configured activities
            are done.
Approval Processes lets you configure an hierarchy of approvals for a business
            operations. An approval process is complete when all the levels of approvals are
            complete.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities

Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).

(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and

Sign-In/Sign-Out Webhook
You can define a configuration to enable the integration of sign-in and sign-out data
            with external systems or URLs. This configuration allows the system to send the sign-in
            and sign-out data through API calls when a user performs a sign-in or sign-out
            activity.
Whenever such an event occurs, the system triggers an event and initiates a POST request
            to the specified submission URL. This request contains important data points such as the
            user's employee ID (empId), sign-in location ID (signInLocationId), sign-out location ID
            (signOutLocationId), sign-in time, and more.
Additionally, you have the option to configure email alerts for data push failures. If
            there are any issues with sending the data to the specified destination, the system can
            notify the designated email addresses, ensuring awareness of any potential communication
            failures.
With this configuration, you can transmit sign-in and sign-out data to external systems
            or URLs via API calls, facilitating data synchronization and enabling further
            integration with other applications.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales

            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales

Managing access to platform is critical from security and audit perspectives. You can set
            up a configuration to automatically block or disable employees based on their last sync
            activity. You need to specify the number of days until last sync to block or disable. If
            the employee last sync is beyond the defined period, the employee will be automatically
            blocked or disabled as per configuration. This configuration allows you to block or
            disable either web employees, mobile employees, or both. You have the flexibility to
            apply this configuration to all employees or restrict it to specific individuals or
            groups of employees.

            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.

Gig User
Gig users, alternatively referred to as gig workers or independent contractors, are
            individuals who opt for temporary, flexible, and project-based work arrangements instead
            of conventional full-time employment. In effort, you can create Gig users and specify
            the log out time for their sessions. These users will be granted limited access to the
            mobile app, enabling them to perform activities within the app from their login time
            until the configured log out time. Once the log out time is reached, their session will
            be automatically terminated.
The Gig users feature provides the organization with the ability to scale the workforce
            based on demand. During periods of temporary workload increase or when specific skills
            are required, gig users can be engaged to fulfill those needs. Employing gig users
            offers cost-effectiveness in comparison to hiring full-time employees, as it helps
            reduce expenses related to benefits, insurance, training, and office space.

You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Employees Registration Flow
The
Employees Registration Flow
feature in the Effort platform allows you to
            streamline and automate the process of creating and managing employee records. It
            provides a convenient way to create employees using a
public link
or
QR
                code
, which can be shared externally.
Key Features
Employee Registration Form Design
The
Employee Registration Flow
begins with a predefined form template
                        containing fields relevant to employee creation. Through the
Modify
                            Design
option, you can:
Add new fields to the registration form.
Update properties of existing fields.
Delete predefined fields as needed.
Employee Master Management Flow
The
Employee Master Management Flow
ensures that form submission
                        fields are correctly mapped to the corresponding employee fields. Any
                        updates or changes to the employee form require corresponding updates to the
                        mapping to ensure accurate data synchronization.
Approval Group Configuration
The
Approval Group Configuration
allows the addition of employees to
                        the employee group responsible for approving employee registrations. By
                        default, the root employee is part of the approval group. This feature
                        allows users to add or remove employees from the approval group, ensuring
                        the right stakeholders are involved in the approval process.
Employee Registration Approval Process
This feature defines how employee registrations are approved. The
Employee Group Based Approval
process is the default setup, but
                        it also supports
Role-Based
and
Hierarchy-Based
approval
                        processes. The approval process can be customized by:
Enabling additional approval levels.
Configuring conditions for editing data, rejecting submissions, and
                                reinitiating flows when data is modified after approval.
Assigning specific roles and permissions at each approval level.
Get Shareable Link/QR Code
The
Get Shareable Link/QR Code
feature provides a
public link
,
code
, or
QR code
that can be shared externally. These
                        options allow external users to access the employee registration form. Once
                        the form is completed and approved, the employee record is created. The link
                        or QR code can be distributed to public recipients, allowing them to create
                        employee records through a simple, streamlined process.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

            activities according to the configured workflow. An instance a process is called Work.
            An Activity process is a collection of activities sequenced using conditions. You cannot
            perform an activity until the previous activities are completed based on the
            configuration. An Activity process is complete only when an End Activity is reached.
The checklist process lets you create the work processes where you can perform the work
            activities in whatever way you want. All the work activities in a checklist process are
            independent and allow you to perform any work activity without depending on the other
            work activities. A Checklist process is complete only when all the configured activities
            are done.
Approval Processes lets you configure an hierarchy of approvals for a business
            operations. An approval process is complete when all the levels of approvals are
            complete.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Lists
A list is a definition of data that is relatively permanent. The definition consists of
            data attributes that identify a collection of items, e.g., a list of Products defined by
            Product Name, Price.
List items are the individual instances of list.
Note:
Even though lists are commonly referred to as masters and both the terms are
            interchangeable, in this document, the pre-defined lists bundled along with the product
            are referred to as masters, and the user-defined list templates are simply referred to
            as lists.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Lists
A list is a definition of data that is relatively permanent. The definition consists of
            data attributes that identify a collection of items, e.g., a list of Products defined by
            Product Name, Price.
List items are the individual instances of list.
Note:
Even though lists are commonly referred to as masters and both the terms are
            interchangeable, in this document, the pre-defined lists bundled along with the product
            are referred to as masters, and the user-defined list templates are simply referred to
            as lists.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve
            territory alignment effectively with EFFORTx platform. In this module, you can:

API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that

            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.

Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.

                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.

You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort

Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales

You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve
            territory alignment effectively with EFFORTx platform. In this module, you can:

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales

            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work

            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.

Lists
A list is a definition of data that is relatively permanent. The definition consists of
            data attributes that identify a collection of items, e.g., a list of Products defined by
            Product Name, Price.
List items are the individual instances of list.
Note:
Even though lists are commonly referred to as masters and both the terms are
            interchangeable, in this document, the pre-defined lists bundled along with the product
            are referred to as masters, and the user-defined list templates are simply referred to
            as lists.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve
            territory alignment effectively with EFFORTx platform. In this module, you can:

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Lists
A list is a definition of data that is relatively permanent. The definition consists of

            Product Name, Price.
List items are the individual instances of list.
Note:
Even though lists are commonly referred to as masters and both the terms are
            interchangeable, in this document, the pre-defined lists bundled along with the product
            are referred to as masters, and the user-defined list templates are simply referred to

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work

            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.

You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales

            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve

API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that

            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.

: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve
            territory alignment effectively with EFFORTx platform. In this module, you can:

API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch

Lists
A list is a definition of data that is relatively permanent. The definition consists of
            data attributes that identify a collection of items, e.g., a list of Products defined by
            Product Name, Price.
List items are the individual instances of list.
Note:
Even though lists are commonly referred to as masters and both the terms are
            interchangeable, in this document, the pre-defined lists bundled along with the product
            are referred to as masters, and the user-defined list templates are simply referred to

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Introduction to Fiscal Calendar

Introduction to Fiscal Calendar
A
fiscal calendar
is a crucial tool for organizing and managing financial periods
            within your organization. Unlike a standard calendar year, which runs from January to
            December, a fiscal calendar allows organizations to define their own financial year
            based on their business cycle. For example, a company might have a fiscal year that
            starts in April and ends in March, instead of following the regular January to December
            pattern.
In the
Effort platform
, the fiscal calendar plays a key role in ensuring that
            targets, performance monitoring, and financial reporting are accurately aligned with the
            organizationâs financial year.
The fiscal calendar is used across various modules in the Effort platform, particularly
            in
target tracking, performance monitoring, and financial reporting
. For
            instance, when setting up targets for employees, teams, or departments, the targets can
            be associated with specific fiscal periods (such as quarterly or annual targets). This
            helps ensure that the performance of individuals and teams is measured based on the
            right fiscal year.
Below are the links to help you manage your fiscal calendars:
Create a Fiscal Calendar
: Learn how
                to set up a new fiscal calendar by providing the necessary details such as the
                calendar name and fiscal year start date.

: Learn how to
                modify an existing fiscal calendar if there are changes to the fiscal year or any
                other attributes.

    You can collaborate with your managers and subordinates to put together these plans.
Day Plans module provides a simpler calendar-based navigation, and helps you to:

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve
            territory alignment effectively with EFFORTx platform. In this module, you can:
Create territories
Map employees to territories
Create pincode based area groups

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

Dropbox
Salesforce

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Summary
The
Target Vs Achievement Summary
offers a clear overview of your performance data
            by comparing set targets with actual achievements. This is essential for assessing
            progress toward goals across various performance metrics, such as
Forms
,
Works
,
Custom Entities
, and
Customer Check-Ins
.
In the summary, you'll find a side-by-side comparison of the target values and actual
            achievements, giving you a quick and easy view of overall performance.
Team Breakdown
The
Team Breakdown
feature allows managers to analyze performance data at the
                individual employee level. For each employee, you can view:
Set Target
: The target assigned to the employee.
Achieved
: The actual performance achieved by the employee.
Progress Bar
: A visual representation of the percentage of the target
                        met. The progress bar changes color based on the level of achievement:
Red
: Low progress
Yellow
: Moderate progress
Green
: High progress
This breakdown makes it easier to monitor individual contributions, track
                performance, and identify employees who may require additional support or
                guidance.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Pages
You can divide the form fields into logical sections as pages to capture the relevant
            information on each page. By default, there is only one page when you try to create a
            new form. You need to add pages and drag and drop the required fields into it.
During configuration, it is exposed like a canvas on which you can drag and drop the
            fields and customize them as needed. Refer to the below screenshot to see how pages
            appear when you are in the form creation screen.
When filling a form, each page is shown as a tab. Refer to the below screenshot to see
            how pages appear in the web app while submitting the form.
To navigate to each tab, the user needs to click on each tab and fill out the form
            fields. It is helpful if you don't want the users to scroll too much and want to fill
            out forms as quickly as possible.

            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow

API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that

            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.

You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and

A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve
            territory alignment effectively with EFFORTx platform. In this module, you can:
Create territories
Map employees to territories

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Manage Feedback
You can configure a customer feedback mechanism to a process. The customer feedback
            mechanism enables the collection of feedback from customers regarding their experience
            with a process by sending a form link. Whenever a process gets completed, the system
            will automatically send notifications to customers, asking them to share their ratings
            or comments. It allows you to configure various aspects of the feedback mechanism, such
            as selecting a feedback form as well as defining notification content, including the
            body, subject, recipient selection, reminder notifications, and more.
To collect customer feedback, you need to create a feedback form and make it a public
            form. Then, during the configuration process, you can select this feedback form. You can
            also customize the content of the feedback notification that gets sent to customers,
            including the recipients, the message body, and the subject of the notification. The
            message body can include a personalized greeting and a short explanation of why their
            feedback is important. The subject should be clear and to the point, explaining the
            purpose of the notification.

Data Provider Bot
Data Provider Bot is atool that could help in transfer/receive data between different
            systems at a Field / Activity level through API calls. The user can control/define the
            next activity based on the previous activity result. This feature will be very helpful
            for use cases where there is a need to connect different 3rd party systems using APIs
            for different fields under a single form submission.
Advantages
Automation
: With APIs, computers rather than people can manage the work.
                    Through APIs, oragnizations can update workflows to make them quicker and more
                    productive.
Application
: Because APIs can access the app components, the delivery of
                    services and information is more flexible.
Independently managed at Field Level
: Each field level API response is
                    dealt with independently so that the result need not be dependent on the entire
                    process.
Control Activities
: Through API, every activity can be controlled based
                    on the previous activity response.
Connect with multiple 3 rd party systems
: Configure activity level, field
                    level, and form level API integrations.

            that process data. It comprises of the following components.
Work Fields represent the data attributes captured and actioned by
                    activities
Work Flow configures the ordering of activities
Rules are a set of conditions and activities to perform when certain conditions
                    are met. There are two types of rules - End Work Rules and Work Reassignment
                    Rules
Activities occur when a task is executed when a criteria is met. There are two
                    types of activities - Activity Condition and Next Activity

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve
            territory alignment effectively with EFFORTx platform. In this module, you can:

Auto Fill Work Attachments Forms
This configuration applies to processes that have attachments. It facilitates the
            automatic transfer of data from work fields or work activities to corresponding fields
            in the attached form. Within this page, you can map work fields or or work activities to
            their respective attached form fields. When a work is created, the values entered in the
            work fields or work activities are automatically populated into the corresponding
            attached form fields.
This feature facilitates you to define two types of configurations.
Attachment Autofill from Normal Fields
: You can define
                    the configuration to auto-copy data from normal work fields to corresponding
                    fields in the attached form. By configuring this option, the values entered in
                    the normal work fields will be transferred and populated into the appropriate
                    fields in the attached form.
Attachment Autofill from Section Fields
: You can define
                    the configuration to auto-copy data from the the work section fields or work
                    activity form fields to corresponding section fields in the attached form. By
                    enabling this configuration, the data from specific section fields or activity

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

            work activity to be performed by the external users. When you set the Activity Type as
            External Activity, the work activity link will be sent to the external users via email
            or SMS based on the configuration as shown below.
The users need to click the link and perform the activity. The external user doesn't need
            Effort credentials to complete the work activity. It is best used for managing workflows
            like new client onboarding, expense and claim management, etc.

Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.

Approval Process
An approval process is a type of workflow an organization uses to approve anything from
            documents, invoices, budgets, purchase orders, etc. Approval processes also allow to
            create and/or modify entities including customer records. Creating an approval process
            means defining the procedures that you will follow to approve or reject work.

            create and/or modify entities including customer records. Creating an approval process
            means defining the procedures that you will follow to approve or reject work.
Role Based Approval Process
: The approvals can be done by
                    a specific role like assistant general manager, vice president, CEO, etc.
Employee Group Based Approval Process
: The approvals can
                    be done by employees in a specific group. Anyone from the configured employee
                    group can approve or reject the form submissions.
Hierarchy Based Approval Process
: The approvals can be
                    done by the immediate manager or everyone in the hierarchy up to the top
                    level.
You can also enable the permissions for an approver to edit the form submission,
            reinitiate flow, reject after approval, etc.
Elements Of An Approval Process
Form Submission
: The process of filling a form and submitting it
            for further processing is called Form Submission. An approval process usually begins
            when a user fills a form and submits it for approval.
Approval Levels
: Approval levels is the hierarchy that is required
            for form submission to go through to get final approval. Let's say you have a process
            that needs multiple approvers from different departments. The step the form submission
            goes to the next approver from the previous approver is called approval level.
Map Approval Process
: Assigning an approval process to a form
            submission. For instance, a user submitting an expense reimbursement form to claim some
            amount that needs the manager's approval before it goes for payment. Here, the expense
            reimbursement form must go for manager approval when a user submits it. Defining this
            configuration is nothing but Map Approval Process.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Email Settings
Within the
Email Settings
page, you can define the configuration
            to create a process based on the customer support request emails. It allows you to
            specify a custom name, your organization's support email, and the requester
            notifications content.
When customers send emails requesting assistance or issue resolution to your
            organization's support email address, the system automatically forwards those emails to
            an internal email address, typically identified as @spoorseffortassist.com.
Upon successful forwarding, the system creates a process or ticket to represent the
            customer's inquiry or issue. This process is a dedicated case that contains relevant
            details from the original email, including the subject, content, and any
            attachments.
After the process (ticket) is created, an automated requester notification is sent to the
            customer. This notification confirms that their support request has been successfully
            received and a process has been initiated. It typically includes a unique process ID or
            ticket number, which serves as a reference for future communication and tracking of the
            support case.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Overview
Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work
            more comfortable while accomplishing their targets. Control, optimize and improve

API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that
            lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many
            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

A list is a definition of data that is relatively permanent. The definition consists of

List items are the individual instances of list.
Note:
Even though lists are commonly referred to as masters and both the terms are
            interchangeable, in this document, the pre-defined lists bundled along with the product
            are referred to as masters, and the user-defined list templates are simply referred to

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales

            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work

            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Lists
A list is a definition of data that is relatively permanent. The definition consists of
            data attributes that identify a collection of items, e.g., a list of Products defined by
            Product Name, Price.
List items are the individual instances of list.
Note:
Even though lists are commonly referred to as masters and both the terms are
            interchangeable, in this document, the pre-defined lists bundled along with the product
            are referred to as masters, and the user-defined list templates are simply referred to

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Hide List Fields in List Picker (Web App)
You can manage the visibility of list fields based on your needs. By default, all fields
            are visible when you publish a list template. This feature allows you to hide
            unnecessary list fields when necessary. In the Web App, clicking on a list field will
            exclude hidden fields from the list selection picker. Note that this functionality is
            exclusive to the Web App; in the mobile app, all list fields remain visible regardless
            of their visibility settings.
For instance, consider a list specification with four fields, where three are set to be
            hidden. If this list specification is used in a form specification, you will not see the
            three hidden fields when selecting from the dropdown in the Web App.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to
                    interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring
: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal
                    achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.

List in List
Overview
The ""list in list"" concept refers to a data structure where one or more lists are
                nested within another list. This is commonly known as a nested list. Nested lists
                enable efficient organization of data by grouping related items together. In an
                application environment, a nested list allows you to create a structured hierarchy
                of data, making it easier to manage and retrieve related information.
Real-Time Scenario
Consider a scenario where you need to manage geographical data efficiently. You can
                create a structured hierarchy using nested lists as follows:
Country List
: A list that contains all the countries.
State List
: A list that contains both Country and State. The
Country
field in this list is mapped to the
Country List
,
                        ensuring each state is associated with its respective country.
City List
: A list that contains
Country, State, and City
. The
Country
and
State
fields are mapped to the
Country
                            List
and
State List
, respectively.
This structure allows filtering at different levels:
Selecting a
Country
filters the available
States
.
Selecting a
State
filters the available
Cities
.
For detailed steps on configuration, refer to the following topics.

            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The
Target VS Achievement
module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform
            designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison
            to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management,
            offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards
            their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with
            actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the
            effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of
            performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets
: You can define targets across various performance
                    metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum
: The
Sum
feature is used to track the total value or amount
                    achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve â¹1 lakh in sales via form
                    submissions, the
Sum
will track the total amount generated by those
                    submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those
                    submissions equals â¹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count
: The
Count
feature tracks the number of occurrences or
                    submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or
                    10 work entries, the
Count
feature will monitor how many times the action
                    was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered
                    achieved.
Tracking Achievements
: The module allows real-time tracking of actual
                    performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics
: It provides visualizations that make it easy to

Territory is a geographic area or customer group that is managed by an individual sales
            person or sales team. These territories are usually defined based on geography (city,
            zip codes, area codes, etc.), sales potential, products groups, historical data, or a
            combination of these factors. The ultimate aim of territory management is to maximize
            the market coverage by optimally utilizing the sales resources. Territory management can
            help spread out the workload for your sales team, allowing them to plan and complete
            tasks more efficiently and effectively, build better customer relationships and follow
            through each and every sales lead brought to their attention. Improve your sales
            efficiency and yield strategic results, maximizing benefit. Make your sales reps work

API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that

            high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive
            revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring
            data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming
            Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API
            calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between
            these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will
            be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the
            configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or
            form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.

Effort NXT Hotel App
The
Effort Hotel App
is an all-in-one solution for managing hotel room
                    activities efficiently. It streamlines room cleaning and service request
                    management while providing real-time operational insights. This app is designed
                    for hotel staff and supervisors to ensure seamless coordination and enhanced
                    service quality by leveraging advanced features and a user-friendly
                    interface.
Key Features and Functionalities
Room Management
Provides a centralized platform to manage hotel room
                                activities.
Displays real-time data on:
Total Number of Rooms
in the hotel.
Number of Serviced Rooms
(cleaned and ready for
                                        occupancy).
Number of Non-Serviced Rooms
(pending cleaning or
                                        maintenance).
Number of Rooms Under Service
Enables supervisors to allocate rooms to service staff for cleaning
                                based on availability.
Service Request Management
Guests can raise service requests easily through two methods:
QR Code Scanning
: Guests scan a QR code in their room
                                        to submit a request.
Email Submission
: Guests send an email describing the
                                        issue to trigger a service request.
The app automatically assigns service requests to available service
                                staff who are currently signed in.
Assignment and Monitoring
Supervisors can assign rooms or service requests to specific service
                                staff from the web app.
Staff can update room cleaning status or service completion in real
                                time.

Knowledge Base
The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The
            knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like
            self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization.
            You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your
            organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a
            knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the
            Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and
            share it with the payroll department only.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. Theyâre
            typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its
            audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys,
            collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information,
            collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in
            processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you
            need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form
            fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data
            capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external
            users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage
            customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a
            form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a
                    field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from
                    scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports
            help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of
            our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee
                and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations
                businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data
                management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information.
                To support these data needs,
Effort
provides the
Entities
module â a
                flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with
                your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical
                information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers,
                manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These
                entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the
                platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create
                entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable
check-in/check-out
functionality with location
                        restrictions.
Perform
form
and
process
activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a
Supplier
entity with fields such as name,
                contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an
Asset
entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance
                schedules, while a
Store
entity could track inventory, address details, and
                manager information.
