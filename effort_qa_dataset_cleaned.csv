Day Plans
Day Plans module lets you plan meetings with your customers, track your progress, capture the activities, and complete your days well. A Day Plan is a list of customers you would like to meet on a specific day. You can create several day plans in advance, and modify them as required. You can collaborate with your managers and subordinates to put together these plans.
Day Plans module provides a simpler calendar-based navigation, and helps you to:
Plan your days for improved visibility and productivity
Proactively meet customers for improved customer satisfaction.
Ensure that meetings happen (studies show that scheduled meetings tend to take place more than the ad-hoc meetings)
Optimize the order in which you would like to meet the customers, to reduce resource wastage (such as time, fuel, energy, and money)
Achieve better customer coverage

Lists
A list is a definition of data that is relatively permanent. The definition consists of data attributes that identify a collection of items, e.g., a list of Products defined by Product Name, Price.
List items are the individual instances of list.
Note: Even though lists are commonly referred to as masters and both the terms are interchangeable, in this document, the pre-defined lists bundled along with the product are referred to as masters, and the user-defined list templates are simply referred to as lists.

Understanding Entities
Overview
Managing data is essential for business operations. This includes not only employee and customer information, but also details about other individuals and organizations businesses interact with, such as suppliers, dealers, and vendors. Effective data management ensures smooth operations and accurate tracking of critical information. To support these data needs, Effort provides the Entities module — a flexible tool for creating and managing structured data categories that align with your business requirements.
Entities are customizable data models that help you capture and store critical information for various purposes. For example, you can use them to track dealers, manage assets, monitor store performance, or organize supplier details. These entities act as master data, meaning they can be referenced and reused across the platform in forms and workflows.
Effort offers a drag-and-drop interface and over 50 data types to help you create entities that fit your needs. You can also:
Enable check-in/check-out functionality with location restrictions.
Perform form and process activities.
Integrate with third-party systems to post or retrieve data.
For example, you can create a Supplier entity with fields such as name, contact details, product offerings, and payment terms. Similarly, an Asset entity might include attributes like serial numbers, locations, and maintenance schedules, while a Store entity could track inventory, address details, and manager information.

Forms
A form is a template used by applications to collect, work and act on data. They’re typically created to obtain a particular set of information a business needs from its audience members. The form can be used to serve any purpose like conducting surveys, collecting feedback, booking orders, capturing sign-in and sign-out information, collecting customer information, etc. Forms reduce paperwork, minimize the time spent in processing, and enable faster transmission of data.
The Effort form builder is bundled with 47+ data types to capture the information you need. You can define validations, conditions, and restrictions to customize the form fields to fulfill the various business needs. The publishing options simplify the data capturing process and allow you to capture information from both internal and external users. Also, you can make the form as an activity, assign approval flows, manage customers, lists, works, etc. Here are some configurations that you can define for a form template:
Make a field appear based on the value of another field
Add extra pages to the form
Enable approval workflow for the form
Restrict form availability to certain employee groups
Send an email notification to administrators whenever a form is submitted
Validate fields using a number of different criteria
Define Form Rules to create dynamic form behavior (for example, show or hide a field based on input in another field)
Drag and drop fields onto the fields canvas
Clone a form from the Forms Marketplace instead of starting a similar form from scratch
Various reports can be generated based on the data collected through forms. These reports help organizations to make informed decisions and analysis.
When creating a new form, you can choose to either start with a blank form or use one of our existing templates from the marketplace and customize it.

The EFFORT Knowledge Base enables the sharing of information to the employee groups. The knowledge base contains articles that provide employees with any information like self-help, troubleshooting, company policies, etc.
You can create and edit knowledge articles to share information across your organization. You can also create multiple folders for different employee groups within your organization to share information within those groups. For example, let's say you have a knowledge article with sensitive payroll information that should be seen only by the Payroll department and not by other groups. You could create a knowledge article and share it with the payroll department only.

Overview
API integration is the connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that lets those systems exchange data. API integrations power processes throughout many high-performing businesses that keep data in sync, enhance productivity and drive revenue. The EFFORT Integrator is an independent tool that could help in transferring data between Spoors & other client systems through Secured Application Programming Interface (API).
You can post the data of the Works and Forms to the configured endpoints using REST API calls. It functions like Data Push functionality, but there is a difference between these two features. In the Data Push, all details of either work or form submission will be pushed to the configured URL whereas, in the Integrator, only the details in the configured fields will be pushed to the selected endpoint. On submission of work or form, the data from the configured fields will be pushed in the selected format.
The EFFORT has the following connectors to post your data.
API
Google Drive
Dropbox
Salesforce
Zapier

Introduction to Target VS Achievement
The Target VS Achievement module is a powerful feature within the Effort platform designed to help organizations set, monitor, and track performance targets in comparison to actual achievements. This module plays a vital role in performance management, offering a clear view of how individuals, teams, or departments are progressing towards their predefined objectives.
The module enables organizations to define performance targets and compare them with actual performance data. This comparison delivers actionable insights into the effectiveness of efforts in achieving specific goals. It supports tracking a variety of performance metrics, helping organizations stay aligned with their objectives.
The module provides the following functionalities:
Setting Targets: You can define targets across various performance metrics, including:
Forms
Works
Custom Entities
Customer Check-Ins
Sum: The Sum feature is used to track the total value or amount achieved. For example, if your target is to achieve ₹1 lakh in sales via form submissions, the Sum will track the total amount generated by those submissions. If 10 submissions are made, and the total value of those submissions equals ₹1 lakh, then you have achieved your target.
Count: The Count feature tracks the number of occurrences or submissions made. For example, if your target is to make 10 form submissions or 10 work entries, the Count feature will monitor how many times the action was performed. Once you reach 10 submissions, the target is considered achieved.
Tracking Achievements: The module allows real-time tracking of actual performance against the set targets.
Visual Analytics: It provides visualizations that make it easy to interpret the comparison between targets and achievements.
Performance Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of progress towards goal achievement ensures timely interventions and adjustments when needed.
